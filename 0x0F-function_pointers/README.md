0x0F-Function Pointers
This directory contains a series of tasks that explore the concept of function pointers in C programming. Function pointers are a powerful tool that allows you to store the address of a function and then call that function indirectly. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as dynamic dispatch and implementing callbacks.

To complete these tasks, you will need to have a basic understanding of C programming, including variables, data types, operators, and control flow statements. You should also be familiar with the concept of pointers, which are variables that store the addresses of other variables.
