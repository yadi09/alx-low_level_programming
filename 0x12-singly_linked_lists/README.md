# 0x12-singly_linked_lists

This repository contains code related to singly linked lists in the C programming language. It includes implementation and manipulation of singly linked lists, along with various operations that can be performed on them.

## Introduction

Singly linked lists are a fundamental data structure used in computer science and programming. They consist of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list.

This repository provides a set of C code files that demonstrate the implementation and usage of singly linked lists. It covers basic operations like creating a list, inserting elements, deleting elements, searching, and traversing the list.
