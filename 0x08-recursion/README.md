   ***Recursion Tasks***

- This directory contains a collection of recursion tasks designed to help you practice and apply the concept of recursion in programming.(DESIGNED BY ALX AFRICA)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ***Prerequisites***

- Before attempting these tasks, it is assumed that you have a basic understanding of programming concepts, including functions, variables, and control flow statements. You should also be familiar with the concept of recursion and how it works.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ***Objectives***

- By completing these tasks, you will gain hands-on experience with recursion and learn to apply it to solve various programming problems. You will also improve your problem-solving skills, develop your understanding of algorithmic thinking, and enhance your ability to write clear and concise code.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ***Tasks***

- The tasks in this directory cover a range of difficulty levels, from beginner to advanced. Each task comes with a detailed description of the problem to be solved, along with clear instructions and hints to guide you through the process.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ***Task 0***
-------------------------
- Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

    - Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);

- The provided code defines a function named _puts_recursion that takes a character pointer s as input. The function recursively prints the characters of the string s one by one. It uses a counter variable i to keep track of the position of the current character in the string. The function calls _putchar to print each character, and then it recursively calls itself to print the next character. The recursion stops when the null terminator \0 is encountered. At that point, the function prints a newline character using _putchar.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ***Task 1***
-------------------------
- Write a function that prints a string in reverse.

     - Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);

- 















-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ***Conclusion***

- By working through these recursion tasks, you will gain a deeper understanding of recursion and its applications in programming. You will also develop your problem-solving skills, enhance your algorithmic thinking, and improve your ability to write elegant and efficient code.
