0x0C-more_malloc_free
This directory contains C programs that demonstrate the use of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using malloc, free, and related functions. Each task is described below along with its corresponding C program.

Files
The following files are present in this directory:

0-malloc_checked.c: This program implements the malloc_checked function, which allocates memory using malloc and terminates the program with an exit status of 98 if the allocation fails.

1-string_nconcat.c: This program implements the string_nconcat function, which concatenates two strings up to the specified number of bytes and returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory.

2-calloc.c: This program implements the _calloc function, which allocates memory for an array of elements and initializes the memory to zero.

3-array_range.c: This program implements the array_range function, which creates an array of integers containing a range of values.

100-realloc.c: This program implements the _realloc function, which reallocates a memory block to a new size, preserving the contents of the original block as much as possible.

101-mul.c: This program multiplies two positive numbers stored as strings and prints the result.


Authors
These C programs were written by [Your Name].
